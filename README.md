This repository holds my personal configurations and scripts for Linux.

## Short time goals

- get a little bit familiar with the `nix` language
- move some of my existing configurations to `home-manager` and this repo
  - be as simple and minimal as possible and only care about my non-work stuff
  - only take care of my primary window manager which is `Awesome`
- if useful rewrite some configs directly in `nix`
- write configuration files for `NixOS`
- try out everything on my personal hardware

## Long time goals

- add `nix` config switches for work stuff and other window manager (e.g. `Sway`)
- look into this `flake.nix` which I see in a lot of config repos
- replace `Arch linux` on my work machine with `NixOS`
- move more and more configurations to the `nix` language
